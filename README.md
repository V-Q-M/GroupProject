# Group Project 2025 PI2

## This is our submission for the 2025 Projects in PI2.

We are merging the classic chess rules with the action component of a 2D Singleplayer-RPG.
For more information see the documentation.

# Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/vqm/GroupProject.git
```

Or use the Intelij `clone repository` option and paste the same URL.

I suggest using Intelij to run the project but using

```
java src/Main.java
```

also works when run from root.
