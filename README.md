# Group Project 2025 PI2

## This is our submission for the 2025 Projects in PI2.

Chess Defense! A 2D-Singleplayer Base-Defender game, where YOU have to defend the castle from the invading black pieces.

Out of the three mottos we picked:

* **Two things that shouldn't go together**. A Base-Defender with a Chess theme, where instead of playing as a hero you play as a Chess piece with an ability inspired by its Chess counterpart.


* **One Rule changes everything**. Instead of a classic hero selection, *Chess Defense* randomly swaps your piece every few seconds turning your strategy upside down and forcing you to adapt quickly. If one piece dies, it cannot be swapped to any longer. Should all pieces die (or just the King) the game is immediately over.

## Pieces and Abilities

### The Rook
The Rook is the de facto range unit. He is best placed at the base line, where he guards an entire row by himself. 

That is why the Rook uses a cannon in our game - providing a safe and flexible playstyle, capable of keeping his enemies on edge from afar.

### The Bishop
The Bishop is a very flexible piece. Its biggest strength however, is when he is left idle on an open diagonal. An unsuspecting player can easily lose his rook to the bishop, if he doesn't pay attention it.

That is why the Bishop is also a ranged unit, which throws a lance diagonally - damaging all enemies that get hit by it. His cumbersome movement takes some time to get used to - as he can only move diagonally. However, his high damage potential makes it worth the effort.

## The Knight
The Knight is unique in the sense that it can jump over other pieces and catch enemies of guard. 

That is why the Knight is a melee/tank unit, which jumps right into his enemies and stomps them to the ground. His high health pool and his ability to jump over projectiles during his attack make him quite resistant.

## The Queen
The Queen - as the most powerful Chess piece excels at flexibility and lethality. 

That is why the Queen is a melee unit, which dashes into the enemies and right out. Picking off enemies one by one.

Her strength makes her a high priority target, which is why we gave the queen a low health pool. Requiring care to play her well.

## The King
The most important unit in Chess is also the weakest. Having mediocre movement and no potential for promotion like pawns - the King would make for a terrible hero. 

That is why we buffed the King, giving him the ability to spawn up to 3 pawns at once, which slowly march forward and attack the first target they meet. Turning the King from the weakest to one of the strongest pieces in our game.

A fun quirk about our King is, that if he dies, the game is immediately over - making the King focus on a more defensive playstyle




# Installation

## Installing an executable
Download the .jar or the .exe file. 

Ensure a JDK of Version 21 is installed (The .exe will remind you if not matching JDK has been found).

If the .jar doesn't run when doubleclicking, try the following command from the same directory as the .jar file
```Bash
java -jar GroupProject.jar
```


## Installing from source

I suggest using the Intelij `clone repository` option. Paste the following URL:
