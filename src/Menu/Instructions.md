# Instructions

Use your keyboard. Mouse is not enabled.

You can use `WASD`, `Arrow-keys` or `VIM-Keys` (`HJKL`).

Attack by pressing  `space`.

Pause the game by pressing `esc`.

# Rules

Your piece gets swapped randomly every few seconds. 

If a piece dies, it cannot be swapped to.

If all pieces die, the game is over.

Hint: If the king dies, the game is also over so be careful.
